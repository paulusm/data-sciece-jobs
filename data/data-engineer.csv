The team have plenty of work to be getting on with and as they are a Consultancy and trusted partner across a variety of industries, you  will have the chance to be involved in an array of work. </p> <p><br /><strong>You … </strong><br />You'll be well versed as a Data Engineer, ideally having worked in a customer or business facing role before. A huge part of this role will be talking to a selection of stakeholders from super technical to complete non-techies. You need to be able to explain  your solutions to both seamlessly. <br />I won't patronise you here by saying you'll need experience of Python or SQL- you're a data engineer after all … <br />An appreciation of various cloud providers would be pretty beneficial though as they work in various environments depending on the customer with a recent push in GCP projects, but as you'd expect plenty of Azure and AWS work as well. A certification in one  or more of these would be a bit of a cherry on top. </p> <p><br /><strong>The company …</strong><br />A boutique data consultancy within a larger organisation, delivering some impressive and complex projects in various sectors. <br />You will have the opportunity to progress your career with well defined bandings and regular feedback. <br />The Senior Management are still very hands on and not in a micro-management, can't let go sort of way, they are still very passionate about the success of the business. </p> <p><br /><strong>The Small Print … (AKA salary &amp; benefits) </strong><br />You will be working remotely initially - obviously, but in the future, there is an expectation to be on client site up to 4 times a week, which can be UK wide. This is a Consulting gig, so you'll need to be comfortable with that.<br />In reality, they will try spread the work as locally as possible and there is a good chance a lot of customers will be happy with remote work going forward. <br />But you need to be prepared to travel as part of the role. <br /><br />Salary wise, there is a wide range on offer as they have multiple roles, but to help you drum down a bit, somewhere between &#163;45-80k &#43; benefits. <br /><br />Please do hit apply and contact Tom Edmondson at Cathcart Associates for a more detailed chat on the role, the company and what you are looking for. <br /><br /></p> "
