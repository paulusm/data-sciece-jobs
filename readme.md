## Challenges

1. What interesting insights can we gain from the datasets?
2. What is the different focus & ewmphasis of the different job roles?
3. What does it tell you about what you need to learn on the MSc?

For basic exploration and analysis, you can use Excel. For more advanced analysis you might want to use a Python language library such as [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) or [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)
